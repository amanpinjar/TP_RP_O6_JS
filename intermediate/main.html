        <h1>Football</h1>
        <p>
          Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple
          cultures.[b] The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick
          ball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association
          football.[16] This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which
          there is scientific evidence, a military manual from the Han
          dynasty.[17] Cuju players would pass the ball around, again having to
          avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was then passed to a
          designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a
          circular goal atop 10-11 meter poles.[18] During the Han dynasty (206
          BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were
          established.[19] Although Fifa suggests there is no indication of any
          direct link between Cuju and association football, Cuju and other
          ancient games demonstrate humanity’s innate predisposition to play
          with a ball.[20] The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju,
          especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the
          inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[21] Other
          East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both
          influenced by cuju.[22][23] Kemari originated after the year 600
          during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive
          game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal
          skin.[24] In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by
          the Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of
          folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the
          ball was kicked through goals".[25] <br />
          <br />Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[17][26] An image
          of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400
          BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[15] appears on the
          UEFA European Championship trophy.[27] Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE,
          mentions the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and
          harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to
          have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than
          what is recognisable as modern football.[19][28][29][30][31][32] As
          with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football
          codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking
          it.[33][34] Association football in itself does not have a classical
          history.[27] Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games
          played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical
          connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside
          Europe.[35] The history of football in England dates back to at least
          the eighth century.[36] The modern rules of association football are
          based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely
          varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.
