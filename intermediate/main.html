          The India national football team represents India in men's
          international football and is governed by the All India Football
          Federation. The team, which is considered as the best team in South
          Asia, won two gold medals at the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games while
          finishing fourth at the 1956 Summer Olympics. India has never
          participated in the FIFA World Cup, although they did qualify by
          default for the 1950 World Cup after all other nations in their
          qualification group withdrew. However, India withdrew prior to the
          beginning of the tournament. The team has also appeared four times in
          the AFC Asian Cup, Asia's top football championship and finished as
          runners-up in 1964. India also participates in the SAFF Championship,
          the top regional football competition in South Asia. They have won the
          tournament record eight times since its inception in 1993. In the 21st
          century, besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, India won the Nehru
          Cup in 2007 and 2009 editions. India also won the 2008 AFC Challenge
          Cup, by which the team qualified for the Asian Cup after 27 years'
          gap.
