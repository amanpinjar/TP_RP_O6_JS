          Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple
          cultures.[b] The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally "kick
          ball"; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association
          football.[16] This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which
          there is scientific evidence, a military manual from the Han
          dynasty.[17] Cuju players would pass the ball around, again having to
          avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was then passed to a
          designated player, who attempted to kick it through the fengliu yan, a
          circular goal atop 10-11 meter poles.[18] During the Han dynasty (206
          BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were
          established.[19] Although Fifa suggests there is no indication of any
          direct link between Cuju and association football, Cuju and other
          ancient games demonstrate humanity’s innate predisposition to play
          with a ball.[20] The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju,
          especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the
          inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[21] Other
          East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both
          influenced by cuju.[22][23] Kemari originated after the year 600
          during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive
          game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal
          skin.[24] In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by
          the Algonquians; it was described as "almost identical to the kind of
          folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the
          ball was kicked through goals"
