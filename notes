why javascript ?
1 Reusability          - companent
2 data managment       - state
3 performence          - virtral DOM / reconcilation
4 HTML - javascript    - JSX (Thr process of using HTML in react is known as JSX)
5 data Flow            -  One way Data binding
6 SPA                  - (A single-page application (SPA) :
                          is a Web app that is presented to the user through a single HTML page to be more responsive and to more closely replicate a desktop application or a native appA single-page application (SPA) is a Web app that is presented to the user through a single HTML page to be more responsive and to more closely replicate a desktop application or a native app)

                          Client-side rendering (CSR) is a web development technique that uses JavaScript to render a website entirely in the browser

7 libraries - SSR(Server-side Rendering ) - next.js

react is used for developer 
website is CSR

single page application issue for SEO
SEO is used for more then one page not for single page website 

react js is javascript libraries user interface for single page application develop by facebook it can create web application that can update the website rendering

key factor it is Reusability
propes are used to transfer the data from parent to child


react use virtral DOM real dom copy whenever the state changes the component it will update the virtral DOM the update the real DOM

JSX is a syntax extension that look same as HTML
it allow the developer HTML code  like  in javascript  

react - Hooks made it easy to add state even to function components
react router

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser

npm allow the developer manages the dependencies for the project

## Notes on JavaScript and React

### JavaScript Fundamentals

1. **Variables**
   - Used to store data values.

2. **Functions**
   - Block of code designed to perform a particular task, executed when called.

3. **Data Types**
   - **String:** Represents textual data.
   - **Boolean:** Represents true or false values.

4. **Operators**
   - Used to perform operations on variables and values.

5. **Arrays**
   - Collection of elements, each identified by an index.

6. **Objects**
   - Collection of key-value pairs.

7. **Array of Objects**
   - An array where each element is an object.

8. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Techniques to dynamically change content, structure, and style of a web page.

9. **Event Handling**
   - Methods to handle user inputs or actions.

### Project

1. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the Browser**
   - Essential technologies for web development:
     - **HTML:** Structure of web pages.
     - **CSS:** Styling of web pages.
     - **JavaScript:** Programming language to make web pages interactive.

### Why JavaScript? 

1. **Reusability**
   - Component-based architecture allows for code reuse.

2. **Data Management**
   - State management to handle data efficiently.

3. **Performance**
   - Virtual DOM and reconciliation enhance performance.

4. **HTML in JavaScript (JSX)**
   - JSX allows writing HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, enhancing readability and development speed.

5. **Data Flow**
   - One-way data binding ensures predictable data flow.

6. **Single Page Application (SPA)**
   - A Web app presented through a single HTML page for better responsiveness and user experience.
   - **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Renders the entire website in the browser using JavaScript.

7. **Libraries and Frameworks**
   - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Next.js:** Improves performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server.

### React.js Overview

1. **React for Developers**
   - JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook.
   - Ideal for creating web applications with dynamic, high-performing interfaces.

2. **SEO Considerations**
   - SPAs can have SEO issues as search engines may struggle to index single-page websites effectively.

3. **Key Features of React**
   - **Reusability:** Components can be reused across the application.
   - **Props:** Used to pass data from parent to child components.
   - **Virtual DOM:** Efficiently updates and renders components by maintaining a virtual representation of the real DOM.
   - **JSX:** Syntax extension that looks similar to HTML, allowing developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.
   - **Hooks:** Simplify adding state and other React features to functional components.
   - **React Router:** Enables navigation and routing within a single-page application.
